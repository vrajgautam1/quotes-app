### How it works:
1. **Images**: You can use the `![alt text](image_url)` syntax to display images. Replace `screenshot.png` with your actual image file name or link.
2. **Links**: The `[text](link)` syntax is used to add clickable links.
3. **Text Formatting**: Markdown allows you to use formatting like **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, and code blocks using backticks.
   - For **bold**: `**bold text**`
   - For *italic*: `*italic text*`
   - For `code`: Use backticks `` `code` ``
